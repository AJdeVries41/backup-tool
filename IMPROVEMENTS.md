### Higher priority
* Program fails when encountering a file on the other drive it needs to overwrite, it will throw an UnauthorizedAccessException

### Lower priority
* Nicer UI in general, the one currently works okay, but when first seeing the UI, it probably isn't really clear how to use the application
* More options to categorize the files by rather than just their extension
* Display more information for each extension rather than just the GB amount. Such as: how many files are there which have this extension
* A way to select the extensions in ExtensionListForm such that it is not necessary to double click on each option.
* Allow to exclude certain folders from the source folder
* Allow to select multiple folders as source folder, and copy them to a single target folder
